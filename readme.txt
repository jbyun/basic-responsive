Basic Starter theme

The basic theme was started 3 years ago with a now retired theme call by fSpring widgets by Fredrik Fahlstad.
At the time, Kubrick was very popular but I felt it just contained too much junk.
Using the fSpring widgets theme, I cleaned it up and created a basic starter theme to use for all of my custom themes.

With the release of Twenty Ten, Devin's Portfolio theme, Michael Fields Ghostbird and Elliot Jay Stocks, Starkers, 
I've had the chance to look at how things are now done and I've refined my theme and improved it immensely.
 

THIS THEME IS TO BE USED FOR BUILDING CUSTOM THEMES ONLY.

It is devoid of design elements and so won't look that great out of the box.
It's also missing some recommended features which would be needed if you wanted to release a theme in the WordPress repository.

For example - my theme does not have comments on pages. I've never coded a site that needs them and so just don't have them in there.
I also don't have the code required doe custom background and colours. I'd rather have control of the design, thank you very much.
The theme doesn't have attachment or links templates... Again, I've never had a need for those.

If you want to create a simple custom theme, this might be the theme for you.
So check it out.
