Basic Starter Theme 
(Christine's Notes)

The basic theme was started 3 years ago with a now retired theme call by fSpring widgets by Fredrik Fahlstad.

At the time, Kubrick was very popular but I felt it just contained too much junk.

Using the fSpring widgets theme, I cleaned it up and created a basic starter theme to use for all of my custom themes.

With the release of Twenty Ten, Devin's Portfolio theme, Michael Fields Ghostbird and Elliot Jay Stocks, Starkers, 

I've had the chance to look at how things are now done and I've refined my theme and improved it immensely.
 
THIS THEME IS TO BE USED FOR BUILDING CUSTOM THEMES ONLY.

It is devoid of design elements and so won't look that great out of the box.
It's also missing some recommended features which would be needed if you wanted to release a theme in the WordPress repository.

For example - my theme does not have comments on pages. I've never coded a site that needs them and so just don't have them in there.

I also don't have the code required doe custom background and colours. I'd rather have control of the design, thank you very much.

The theme doesn't have attachment or links templates... Again, I've never had a need for those.

If you want to create a simple custom theme, this might be the theme for you.
So check it out.

You can check out a demo of the theme here.

Basic Responsive
**Featuring HTML5 and Media Queries** 
(James' Notes)

It's becoming pretty evident now that HTML5 and CSS3 and starting to creep into the web world at a rate that's becoming increasingly fast. 

With an increasing demand for mobile compatibility and the semantic sexiness of HTML5 tags, I decided to brew up a "Responsive" version of Christine Rondeau's (Bluelime Media) Basic template which I almost always use.

As the name suggests, it's a basic template that will help you get started. Of course there's so much more you can do what with all the new CSS3 selectors and what not but to get your feet wet and comfortable with this new fangled web tech it should be a pretty good way to get going.

FURTHER NOTES
-------------------------

- Right out of the box, this template is responsive to Netbooks ("larger" and smaller), iPads and iPhones. 

- The header image that changes along with the browser is there strictly to be a visual cue so you know which size you're looking at. You can do whatever you like with it.

- Should there be any bugs, anything that you catch, let me know via email (james@byuncreative.com) and I'll update it as soon as I can.

- Want to see a sample? Too bad. You'll have to check out the sample from Christine's Notes up top. 
Use your imagination and make sound effects while you resize the browser… or just install the theme and find out.
