Responsive Basic (HTML5 + Media Queries)

It's becoming pretty evident now that HTML5 and CSS3 and starting to creep into the web world at a rate that's becoming increasingly fast. With the booming demand for mobile compatibility and the semantic usefulness of HTML5, I decided to create a "Responsive" version of Christine Rondeau's(Bluelime Media) Basic template free for use. 

As the name suggests, it's a basic template that will help you get started. Of course there's so much more you can do what with all the new CSS3 selectors and what not but to get your feet wet and comfortable with this new fangled web tech it should be a pretty good way to get going.
