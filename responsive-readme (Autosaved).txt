Responsive Basic (HTML5 + Media Queries)

It's becoming pretty evident now that HTML5 and CSS3 and starting to creep into the web world at a rate that's becoming increasingly fast. 

With an increasing demand for mobile compatibility and the semantic sexiness of HTML5 tags, I decided to brew up a "Responsive" version of Christine Rondeau's (Bluelime Media) Basic template which I almost always use.

As the name suggests, it's a basic template that will help you get started. Of course there's so much more you can do what with all the new CSS3 selectors and what not but to get your feet wet and comfortable with this new fangled web tech it should be a pretty good way to get going.

Further notes:

Right out of the box, this template is responsive to Netbooks ("larger" and smaller), iPads and iPhones. 

The header image that changes along with the browser is there strictly to be a visual cue so you know which size you're looking at. You can do whatever you like with it.
